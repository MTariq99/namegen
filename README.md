NameGen Package
The namegen package generates unique names from a predefined list using a customizable seed for randomness. This README provides an overview of how to use the package, its uniqueness, and details about the generated names.

Installation
To use the namegen package, ensure you have Go installed. You can install the package with go get:

bash
```
go get -u github.com/MTariq99/namegen
```

Usage
Importing the Package
Import the namegen package in your Go files:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "github.com/MTariq99/namegen"
)
```
Initializing the Generator
Initialize a new name generator with a seed:

```go
seed := int64(42) // Replace with your desired seed
generator := namegen.NewGenerator(seed)
Generating Unique Names
//Use the GetUniqueName method to generate unique names:
```

```go
Copy code
name1 := generator.GetUniqueName()
name2 := generator.GetUniqueName()

fmt.Println(name1)
fmt.Println(name2)
//Each call to GetUniqueName returns a unique name based on the seed provided.
```

Uniqueness
The uniqueness of the names generated by namegen is ensured through:

Customizable Seed: You can specify a seed to generate different sequences of names. Changing the seed will produce different unique names while maintaining the sequence order.
Large Name Pool: The package includes a substantial pool of names (425 in total) ensuring a wide variety of unique combinations.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating the usage of the namegen package:

```go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/MTariq99/namegen"
)

func main() {
    seed := int64(12345) // Example seed
    generator := namegen.NewGenerator(seed)

    fmt.Println(generator.GetUniqueName())
}
```
