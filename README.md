NameGen Package
The namegen package generates unique names from a predefined list using a customizable seed for randomness. This README provides an overview of how to use the package, its uniqueness, and details about the generated names.

Installation
To use the namegen package, you need to have Go installed. You can then install the package using go get:

bash
Copy code
go get -u github.com/yourusername/namegen
Replace github.com/yourusername/namegen with the actual path to your repository on GitHub or any other version control system.

Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can use the namegen package:

Import the namegen package in your Go files:

go
Copy code
import (
"fmt"
"math/rand"
"github.com/yourusername/namegen"
)
Initialize a new name generator with a seed:

go
Copy code
seed := int64(42) // Replace with your desired seed
generator := namegen.NewGenerator(seed)
Generate unique names using the GetUniqueName method:

go
Copy code
name1 := generator.GetUniqueName()
name2 := generator.GetUniqueName()

fmt.Println(name1)
fmt.Println(name2)
The names generated will be unique based on the seed provided.

Uniqueness
The uniqueness of the names generated by namegen comes from:

Customizable Seed: You can specify a seed to generate different sequences of names. Changing the seed will produce different unique names while maintaining the sequence order.

Large Name Pool: The package includes a large pool of names (425 in total) ensuring a wide variety of unique combinations.

Limitations
Finite Name List: The uniqueness of names depends on the predefined list available in the consts/names.go file. Adding or modifying names in this list can increase the variety of generated names.
Example
Here is an example demonstrating the usage of the namegen package:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math/rand"
"github.com/yourusername/namegen"
)

func main() {
seed := int64(12345) // Example seed
generator := namegen.NewGenerator(seed)

    fmt.Println(generator.GetUniqueName())

}
Replace github.com/yourusername/namegen with your actual repository path on GitHub or any other version control system.
